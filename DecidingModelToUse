#Types of Machine Learning Models
#Supervised Learning when the inputs have data labels
#Unsupervised Learning when the inputs don't have labels
#Reinforcement Learning when the data has states & actions
#In Python follow the flow chart for scikit learn https://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/machine_learning_map/index.html
